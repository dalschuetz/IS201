        <h2>Cantrips</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fire Bolt</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Mage Hand</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

                    You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.
                    
                    The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Mending</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

                    This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Minor Illusion</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again. If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Prestidigitation</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

                    You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
                    You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
                    You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
                    You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
                    You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
                    You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.
                    
                    If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Toll the Dead</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h2>1st Level</h2>

               <ol>
                <li>Detect Magic</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

                            The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Disguise Self</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You make yourself--including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person--look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

                        The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
                        
                        To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
                        </li>
                </ul>
                <li>False Life</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Identify</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

                        If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Shield</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Unseen Servant</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.

                        Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command.
                        
                        If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Witch Bolt</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell’s range or if it has total cover from you.                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <ul>
                       <li>You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.

                        Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Invisibility</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>3rd Level</h2>
        <input type = checkbox><input type = checkbox><input type = checkbox>
       <ol>
        <li>Counterspell</li>
        <ul>
            <li>You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Fireball</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

                The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Tiny Hut</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its area.

                Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can't extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.
                
                Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it is transparent from the inside.</li>
        </ul>
       </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>4th Level</h2>
        <input type = checkbox><input type = checkbox><input type = checkbox>
        <ol>
            <li>Dimension Door</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such as "200 feet straight downward" or "upward to the northwest at a 45- degree angle, 300 feet."

                    You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.
                    
                    If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Polymorph</li>                <ul>
                <li>This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.

                    The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.
                    
                    The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.
                    
                    The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
                    
                    The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Storm Sphere</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell’s duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage. The sphere’s space is difficult terrain.

                    Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 lightning damage.
                    
                    Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to listen.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>5th Level</h2>
        <input type = checkbox><input type = checkbox>
        <ol>
            <li>Conjure Elemental</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

                    The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.
                    
                    If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.
                    
                    The GM has the elemental's statistics. Sample elementals can be found below.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Geas</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.

                    You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.
                    
                    You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish spell also ends it.</li>
